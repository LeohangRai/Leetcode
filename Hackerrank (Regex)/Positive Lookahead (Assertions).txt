# Positive Lookahead (Assertions)
Syntax:  regex_1(?=regex_2)

The positive lookahead (?=) asserts regex_1 to be immediately follwed by regex_2. But the lookahead is excluded form the match.
it does not return matches of regex_2.
The lookahead only asserts whether a match is possible or not and that's all.

Example:
Regex: c(?=o)
Test String: chocolate

It will match the 'c' that is followed by an 'o' in the given string but won't match/select the 'o' itself.
It only matches the 'c' that is followed by an 'o' without actually selecting/matching the succeding 'o'.

# Question
You have a test string S.
Write a regex that can match all occurrences of 'o' followed immediately by 'oo' in S.


# Solution
var Regex_Pattern = /o(?=oo)/g;	//Do not delete `/` and `/g`.
