# Positive Lookbehind
Syntax: (?<=regex_2)regex_1

Here, The positive lookbehind (?<=) asserts regex_1 to be immediately preceded by regex_2.
But just like Lookaheads, Lookbehinds are also excluded from the match. 
This means, "do not consume matches of regex_2, but only assert whether a match is possible or not".

# Example:
Regex: (?<=[a-z])[aeiou]
Test String: he1o

Let's look at the test string "he1o".
The 1st character 'h' is preceded by nothing. So it is not matched by the regex.
The 2nd character 'e' is preceded by a lower case letter (h), so it is matched by the regex.
The 3rd chracter '1' is not a lower case letter, so it is not matched by the regex.
The 4th character 'o' is preceded by a digit (1), so it is not matched by the regex either.

So the only sub-string matched by the regex would be the "e" after the first "h".


# Question
You have a test String S.
Write a regex which can match all the occurences of digit which are immediately preceded by odd digit.

# Solution (Python)
Regex_Pattern = r"(?<=[13579])\d"	# Do not delete 'r'.
