# Branch Reset Groups
NOTE:  Branch reset group is supported by Perl, PHP, Delphi and R.

Syntax:
(?|regex)

A branch reset group consists of alternations and capturing groups. (?|(regex1)|(regex2))
Alternatives in branch reset group share same capturing group.

# Example
Regex pattern: (?|(Haa)|(Hee)|(bye)|(k))\1
Test String: HaaHaakk

Here, the regex pattern is matched with the Test String.


# Question
You have a test string S.
Your task is to write a regex which will match S, with following condition(s):

- S consists of 8 digits.
- S must have "---", "-", "." or ":" separator such that string S gets divided in 4 parts, with each part having exactly two digits.
- S string must have exactly one kind of separator.
- Separators must have integers on both sides.


# Valid S:
12-34-56-78
12:34:56:78
12---34---56---78
12.34.56.78


# Invalid S:
1-234-56-78
12-45.78:10


# Solution:
NOTE: I did this in PHP since it is not separated by NodeJs.

$Regex_Pattern = '/^\d{2}(?|(---)|(-)|(\.)|(:))\d{2}\1\d{2}\1\d{2}$/';
