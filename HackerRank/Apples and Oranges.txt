/*
s -> Starting point of the house
t -> Ending point of the house
a -> Position of the apple tree
b -> Position of the orange tree

apples -> An array of distances as elements at which all the apples fall
oranges -> An array of distances as elements at which all the oranges fall


The distance at which the apple or oranges fall can be either +ve or -ve in the x-axis.
-ve meaning the left side +ve meaning the right side.

For each element of the apples array, add the element to location point of the apple tree, i.e. "a". (Use map)
Then from the newly created array, check if the elements are in the range between "s" and "t", which are the co-ordinates of the house.
Here "s" and "t" values are inclusive.

numApples = 0;
apples.map( distance => a + distance ).forEach(item => item <= s && item >= t ? numApples +=1 : null );
