# Tree: Preorder Traversal
Complete the "preOrder" function in the editor below, which has 1 parameter: a pointer to the root of a binary tree. 
It must print the values in the tree's preorder traversal as a single line of space-separated values.

# Input Format
Our test code passes the root node of a binary tree to the preOrder function.

# Constraints
1 <= Nodes in the tree  <= 500

# Output Format
Print the tree's preorder traversal as a single line of space-separated values.


# Solution
Since we need to print the result in a single line, if we are doing this is JS, we will have to accumulate the traversed node datas in a string.
This is because inside of console.log() we cannot specify the separator value.
It is always going to be a new line.
If we had done this in Python, we could have simply used print() with sep = ' '.


# Implementation (NodeJs)
var stringResult = '';
function preOrderAcc(root) {
    if(root != undefined) {
        stringResult += (root.data.toString() + ' ');
        preOrderAcc(root.left);
        preOrderAcc(root.right);
    }
}

function preOrder(root) {
    preOrderAcc(root);
    console.log(stringResult);
}


# Implementation (Python)
def preOrder(root):
    if root is not None:
        print(root.info, end = ' ')	
        preOrder(root.left)
        preOrder(root.right)
