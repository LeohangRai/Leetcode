# Question

This is a staircase of size n = 4:
   #
  ##
 ###
####
Its base and height are both equal to 4. It is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.
Write a program that prints a staircase of size n.

Input Format:
A single integer, n, denoting the size of the staircase.

Output Format:
Print a staircase as described above.


Solution Explanation:
We need to print a staircase such that the base and height are same, i.e. equal to the parameter "n".
The staircase is right shifted, i.e. the #'s are shifted to the right side.
When n = 4:
In the first line, there are 3 spaces and 1 hash.
In the second line, there are 2 spaces and 2 hashes.
In the thir line, there is 1 space and 3 hashes.
In the fourth (n = 4) line, there are 0 spaces and 4 hashes.

From this, we can gather that,
For each iteration of the loop from 1 to n:
If i = 1, spaces = n-1 = 4-1 = 3 && hashes = n-spaces = 4-3 = 1
If i = 2, spaces = n-2 = 4-2 = 2 && hashes = n-spaces = 4-2 = 2
If i = 3, spaces = n-3 = 4-3 = 1 && hashes = n-spaces = 4-1 = 3
If i = 4, spaces = n-4 = 4-4 = 0 && hashes = n-spaces = 4-0 = 4

Let's translate this into code.

Solution:
function staircase(n) {
    let i = 1;
    let staircase = '';
    while (i <= n) {
        let spaceCount = n - i;
        let hashCount = n - spaceCount;
        staircase += (' '.repeat(spaceCount) + '#'.repeat(hashCount));
        staircase += '\n';
        i += 1;
    }
    console.log(staircase);
}
