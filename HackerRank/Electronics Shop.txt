A person wants to determine the most expensive computer keyboard and USB drive that can be purchased with a give budget. Given price lists for keyboards and USB drives and a budget, find the cost to buy them. If it is not possible to buy both items, return .

Initialize the mostExp variable with value = 0.
Loop through the keyboards array.
For each keyboard find the sum of its cost combined with each drive from the "drives" array.
For each iteration, check if the sum is less than or equal to the budget.
And, if this combination is greater than the mostExp variable, then replace it with this new value.

At the end of the 2 loops, if the mostExp variable's value is still 0, this means that there are no combinations available for the given budget, so return -1.
Otherwise, return the value of mostExp.


function getMoneySpent(keyboards, drives, b) {    /*
     * Write your code here.
     */ 
    let mostExp = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i < keyboards.length; i++) {
        if(keyboards[i] >= b) {
            continue;
        }
        
        for(let j = 0; j < drives.length; j++) {
            let newCombination = keyboards[i] + drives[j];
            if( newCombination <= b && newCombination > mostExp) {
                mostExp = newCombination;
            }
        } 
    }
    if(mostExp == 0) {
        return -1;
    } else {
        return mostExp;
    }
}
