# Tree: Level Order Traversal
Given a pointer to the root of a binary tree, you need to print the level order traversal of this tree. In level-order traversal, nodes are visited level by level from left to right. Complete the function "levelOrder" and print the values in a single line separated by a space.


# Solution:
Since we need to print the result in a single line, if we are doing this is JS, we will have to accumulate the traversed node datas in a string.
This is because inside of console.log() we cannot specify the separator value.
It is always going to be a new line.
If we had done this in Python, we could have simply used print() with sep = ' '.


# Implementation (NodeJs)
var resultString = '';

function levelOrder(root) {
    levelOrderAcc(root);
    console.log(resultString);
}

function levelOrderAcc(root) {
    let queue = [];
    queue.push(root);
    while(queue.length != 0) {
        let parent = queue.shift() // dequeue the first element
        resultString += (parent.data + ' ');
        if(parent.left) {
            queue.push(parent.left);
        }
        if(parent.right) {
            queue.push(parent.right);
        }
    }
}


# Implementation (Python)
def levelOrder(root):
    queue = []
    queue.append(root)
    while len(queue) != 0:
        parent = queue.pop(0) # dequeu the first element
        print(parent.info, end = ' ')
        if parent.left:
            queue.append(parent.left)
        if parent.right:
            queue.append(parent.right)
