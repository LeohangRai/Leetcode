# Question
Consider an array of numeric strings where each string is a positive number with anywhere from 1 to 10^6 digits. Sort the array's elements in non-decreasing, or ascending order of their integer values and return the sorted array.

Example
unsorted = ['1', '200', '150', '3']
Return the array ['1', '3', '150', '200'].

# Constraints
- 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
- Each string is guaranteed to represent a positive integer.
- There will be no leading zeros.
- The total number of digits across all strings in "unsorted" is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive).
