# Camel Case
There is a sequence of words in CamelCase as a string of letters, s, having the following properties:
- It is a concatenation of one or more words consisting of English letters.
- All letters in the first word are lowercase.
- For each of the subsequent words, the first letter is uppercase and rest of the letters are lowercase.
Given s, determine the number of words in s.

# Example
s = 'oneTwoThree'

There are 3 words in the string: 'one', 'Two', 'Three'.

# Input Format
A single line containing string s.

# Returns
int: the number of words in s.


# Solution:
If the length of the string 's' is greater than 0, there will always be at least one word in the given string.
So, if s.length > 0,  initialize the value of wordCount with 1, else set it as 0.
Now, loop through the string to see the number of times, an Upper Case letter appears and increase the value of wordCount accordingly.
This gives the total number of words included by the given string.

function camelcase(s) {
    // Write your code here
    let wordCount = s.length > 0 ? 1 : 0;
    for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if(s[i].toUpperCase() === s[i]) {
            wordCount += 1;
        }
    }
    return wordCount;
}
