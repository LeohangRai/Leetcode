# Ollivander's Inventory

NOTE: Look at the question on the original link to figure out the structure of the tables.
Harry Potter and his friends are at Ollivander's with Ron, finally replacing Charlie's old broken wand.
Hermione decides the best way to choose is by determining the minimum number of gold galleons needed to buy each non-evil wand of high power and age. Write a query to print the id, age, coins_needed, and power of the wands that Ron's interested in, sorted in order of descending power. If more than one wand has same power, sort the result in order of descending age.



SELECT wand.id, prop.age, wand.coins_needed, wand.power
FROM Wands as wand
    JOIN Wands_Property as prop
        ON wand.code = prop.code
WHERE 
    prop.is_evil = 0 
    AND wand.coins_needed = (SELECT MIN(coins_needed)
                            FROM Wands as wand2
                            JOIN Wands_Property as prop2
                            ON wand2.code = prop2.code 
                            WHERE wand2.power = wand.power AND prop2.age = prop.age)
ORDER BY wand.power DESC, prop.age DESC;
