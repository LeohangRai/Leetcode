Challenges (Basic Join)


# Analysis
"Print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. "
So, we need to calculate the total number of challenges created by each of the hackers.

If multiple hackers have created the same number of challenges but the count of their challenges is less than the maximum created by a single hacker, then we need to exclude these hackers.
For this, we need to get the maximum number of challenges created by a single hacker.

# Joins the tables
SELECT h.hacker_id, h.name, COUNT(ch.hacker_id) as cnt, MAX(ch.hacker_id)
FROM Hackers h
JOIN Challenges ch
ON h.hacker_id = ch.hacker_id
GROUP BY ch.hacker_id, h.name
ORDER BY COUNT(h.hacker_id) DESC;


# Gets the maximum challanges count for a single hacker
SELECT MAX(challenges_count) as max_challenges_count
FROM
    (SELECT hacker_id, COUNT(hacker_id) as challenges_count
    FROM Challenges
    GROUP BY hacker_id
    ORDER BY COUNT(hacker_id) DESC) challenge_counts;
